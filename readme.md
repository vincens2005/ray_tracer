A fun little ray tracer based on [ray tracing in one weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) in C, using raylib

That's right, instead of vomiting out an image to the standard output, we progressively refine one in raylib. We're also using C instead of C++ because of [what linus said](https://lwn.net/Articles/249460/) (and because I like C)

clone this repo with `--recursive` and do `make run`. on windows idk what you do but it should be compatible. yeah.
